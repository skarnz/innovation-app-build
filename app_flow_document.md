# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user accesses the platform, they are greeted by a modern landing page featuring a dark theme with navy backgrounds and electric blue or purple accents. The landing page clearly offers options to create an account or sign in using email credentials. There is also an option for social login through OAuth integrations with GitHub and Google Docs. This means that a user can quickly establish their identity through either entering their email and a new password or simply clicking on one of the social sign-in buttons, which then securely connects through the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For those who have forgotten their password, a visible 'Forgot Password' link is provided to initiate a password recovery process using email verification. Signing out is equally straightforward, with a dedicated logout button available in the user profile area. This setup ensures that every new user or returning user can effortlessly access the platform using familiar authentication methods while the system prioritizes security from the start.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user is taken to the central dashboard. This page is designed to be both visually appealing and highly functional, with a consistent dark interface featuring futuristic touches like Orbitron fonts and electric accent colors. The layout is organized in a focus-driven manner, with a header that includes dynamic breadcrumbs to show the user's navigation path, allowing them to easily return to previous pages with back arrows. Prominently displayed on the dashboard is the navigation hub, which serves as the starting point for all project-related activities. The sidebar provides clear links to different phases of the product development lifecycle, and each section such as Project Setup, Ideation, Validation, and so on is neatly organized. This intuitive setup ensures that users always know where they are and how to move to the next step in their project journey.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Upon starting a project, the first phase encountered is the Project Setup, where users are presented with an interactive Product Type Selector showcasing options like Physical Product, Software, or Service. When a user selects a product type, the selection is instantly saved globally through localStorage for later reference and a toast notification confirms the choice. After this phase, the journey continues to Ideation, where the interface provides flexible inputs such as text areas and idea cards. In this phase, users can record project names, highlight key problems, and offer initial solutions. They also have access to a special section for Counter-Intuition Exploration, where guided prompts like “What if the opposite?” push them to think in unconventional ways. As the user moves forward into the Validation phase, the interface shifts to a tab-based layout featuring multiple components such as Data Partner Integration, Survey Management, and Results Analysis. Each tab is fully integrated, letting users select market research tools, design surveys, and even capture analysis notes, all of which are saved and viewable within the platform.

Beyond the initial phases, the system naturally transitions into strategic planning areas such as Business Model & Value Chain. Here, users can work on a digital Business Model Canvas with clear sections for each part of the strategic plan, or create detailed analyses for competition and market trends. Moving into the MVP Specification phase, the experience is greatly enhanced by the ever-present AI Agent. This floating or docked assistant guides the user through a series of prompts to define key features. The user is asked to input a feature name, description, user story, acceptance criteria, and priority. Upon completion, the system automatically generates a standardized, formatted specification document and saves it into the File Management System. The journey continues with subsequent phases like Prototyping where the system adapts based on the previously chosen product type. For software projects, the user is directed to interactive wireframing tools and even architecture generation using MermaidJS. For services, there are blueprints and operational flows, and for physical products, there is a 3D modeling interface with integrated file uploads and API-driven model generation. The final phase covers Marketing where a visually interactive timeline allows users to schedule campaigns by dragging platform icons onto a Gantt-like chart. An automation flow canvas is also available to sketch out campaign sequences, and a dedicated generative video interface lets them experiment with video content creation. Throughout each of these transitions, users can easily move back to previous steps using sequential Next and Back buttons, and every change is recorded via localStorage ensuring that the entire project flow is connected and seamless.

## Settings and Account Management
Users have access to a dedicated settings area where they manage their personal information, preferences, and notifications in a clearly labeled interface. This page is accessible from the main dashboard and offers a clean, futuristic interface that is consistent with the rest of the platform. Within settings, users can update their email, password, and profile picture, as well as configure detailed notification preferences so they are alerted about project updates, file sync issues, or important AI Agent suggestions. In cases where billing or subscription management is applicable, the same area extends to include information on plan details and payment methods. Once users finish making changes, they simply click a save button and are returned to the main application flow without any disruption, ensuring the overall management experience is both secure and user-friendly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a user enters invalid data or encounters connectivity issues, the platform provides clear, context-sensitive error messages that appear in real time. For instance, during sign-up, if an email is entered in the wrong format, a concise and easy-to-understand error notice explains exactly what needs to be corrected. In stages involving external integrations such as with GitHub or Google Docs, error handling is robust. If an OAuth connection fails, the user is immediately notified with a message explaining the issue and suggested recovery steps. In the event of network failures or disrupted state persistence, the system automatically falls back to localStorage or IndexedDB so that work is not lost, and the user is prompted to either retry the operation or continue offline until connectivity is restored. Even in advanced modules like the generative video interface or 3D modeling sessions, if an API call returns an error, graceful degradation ensures that the rest of the application remains functional and clear instructions are provided to help the user re-initiate the failed task. These error safeguards and alternate paths ensure that users remain firmly in control and that the overall experience is both resilient and transparent.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user signs up or logs in, their journey is designed to be highly intuitive and connected. The platform starts by welcoming the user with a modern landing and sign-on experience that supports multiple secure methods. Once inside, the central dashboard functions as the control room where every phase of the product development lifecycle can be easily navigated. Detailed flows guide the user through project setup, ideation, validation, and strategic business planning, ensuring that every decision is saved and contextualized by state persistence. Advanced steps such as the MVP Specification and Prototyping phases are enriched with a persistent AI Agent that offers guidance tailored to established internal standards and templates. The integrated File Management System centralizes all documentation and asset handling with secure third-party integrations such as GitHub and Google Docs. Finally, a comprehensive marketing module brings the user’s project to life with visual timelines and automation flows. In every phase, error handling and fallback strategies are in place to maintain a smooth user experience even when problems arise. This complete journey equips entrepreneurs, startup teams, and innovation managers with all the tools needed to systematically develop, validate, and launch a successful minimum viable product.
