# Backend Structure Document

This document explains the backend setup for our MVP development platform in everyday language. It covers how the system is built, how data is managed, what services and safeguards are used, and overall how everything works together to deliver a smooth experience for entrepreneurs, startup teams, and innovation managers.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is built using a simple but robust architecture that focuses on ease of use, scalability, and reliability. Here’s an overview:

- **Framework & Language**: We use Node.js with the Express framework. This means the server is built using JavaScript, making it fast and efficient at handling many requests at once.
- **Design Patterns**: We follow common design patterns like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) to organize code into logical sections. This ensures that our code remains easy to maintain and modify as the project evolves.
- **Scalability & Performance**: The system is designed so that as more users join, we can distribute the load efficiently. For example, separate parts of the system (like user authentication and file management) can be updated or scaled independently.
- **Integration Ready**: The backend is built with integration in mind. We easily connect to external systems such as GitHub, Google Docs, and various AI APIs, using clear APIs and standardized OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

## 2. Database Management

We manage our data with thoughtful consideration for how data is stored, accessed, and maintained:

- **Database Type**: We use a relational database (SQL) relying on PostgreSQL. This is chosen for its reliability, performance, and strong support for structured data.
- **Data Organization**: Our data is well-structured into different tables for users, projects, files, and integrations. This makes it straightforward to search, update, and manage data in real time.
- **Data Management Practices**:
  - Regular backups and data replication ensure data is safe.
  - Proper indexing is used so data can be accessed quickly, even as the database grows.

## 3. Database Schema

Our PostgreSQL database is organized into several key components. Below is a human-readable description of our schema:

- **Users**: Contains details about every user of the platform, including email, username, role (Project Admin, Team Collaborator, Solo Entrepreneur), and authentication data.
- **Projects**: Holds information about each project, such as the project name, type (Physical Product, Software, Service), creation date, and project-specific settings.
- **Files**: Maintains records for the File Management System. It tracks file names, locations (which might be in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage), metadata, and pointers to the associated project or folder.
- **Integrations**: Stores data related to external services (like GitHub, Google Docs) including OAuth tokens and sync statuses.

For those who prefer a more technical outline, here’s an example PostgreSQL schema structure:

• Table: Users
  - id (Primary Key)
  - email
  - password hash
  - username
  - role
  - created_at

• Table: Projects
  - id (Primary Key)
  - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
  - project_name
  - product_type
  - created_at

• Table: Files
  - id (Primary Key)
  - project_id (Foreign Key referencing Projects)
  - file_name
  - file_path
  - file_type
  - uploaded_at

• Table: Integrations
  - id (Primary Key)
  - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
  - service_name (e.g., GitHub, Google Docs)
  - oauth_token
  - connected_at

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

APIs form the bridge between the frontend and the backend. Our API design is clean and straightforward:

- **RESTful API**: We follow RESTful design principles, meaning each URL endpoint corresponds to an action on a resource. For example, /users for user data, /projects for project management, and /files for the File Management System.
- **Key Endpoints and Their Purposes**:
  - **/login & /logout**: Handle user authentication using OAuth 2.0. This helps to securely connect with third-party services like GitHub and Google Docs.
  - **/projects**: Create, read, update, and delete project information. This endpoint ensures that every project is tracked from ideation to execution.
  - **/files**: Upload and manage documents and assets. This supports the centralized file system required by our platform.
  - **/ai**: Interface with our context-aware AI Agent. It receives requests to provide suggestions, automate document formatting, or validate inputs.
  - **/integrations**: Manage external API interactions, including error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable connection to services like meshy.ai and video generation providers.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

Our project is hosted on a reliable cloud platform that promises scalability and high availability. Key details include:

- **Cloud Provider Options**:
  - **AWS or Google Cloud**: Both are considered for hosting our backend. These services offer flexibility, robust performance, and strong support for both compute and storage needs.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**: The chosen services ensure that we only pay for what we use, which is ideal during the initial MVP phase and scalable as we grow.
  - **Global Reach**: Cloud hosting ensures low latency and high-speed access from anywhere in the world.

- **File Storage**: Projects’ files are stored in either AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This not only supports large file sizes but also offers high durability and easy retrieval.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Several supporting components help our backend work smoothly and efficiently:

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute incoming traffic evenly across our server instances to prevent any one server from becoming overloaded.
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Use in-memory caching (for example, Redis) to quickly provide frequently requested data and speed up API responses.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Used for serving static assets like images, scripts, and stylesheets quickly, ensuring an excellent user experience even for distant users.
- **Cloud Storage & Backups**: Regular data backup routines and cloud storage integration ensure that user data is secure and always available.

## 7. Security Measures

Securing our backend and data is paramount. Here’s how we ensure safety and compliance:

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - OAuth 2.0 is used for both user logins and third-party integrations, adding a layer of security when interacting with external services.
  - Secure session management, ensuring users’ sessions are protected.
- **Data Encryption**: Data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent attackers from injecting harmful data.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Frequent security checks help us stay compliant with current regulations and swiftly patch any vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Robust logging and error detection mechanisms ensure that any security or performance issues are quickly identified and remedied.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping the backend healthy and reliable involves continuous monitoring and planned maintenance:

- **Monitoring Tools**: We use various monitoring tools to track the performance, health, and security of our servers. Measurements include uptime, response times, and error rates.
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logs help us debug and trace any incidents, ensuring that errors can be quickly identified and resolved.
- **Maintenance Strategies**:
  - Routine updates and patches are applied to all components to ensure they remain secure.
  - Scheduled backups and testing ensure that the system remains reliable even during periods of heavy use.
