# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Project Overview

This platform is a guided, structured environment designed to help entrepreneurs, startup teams, and innovation managers take an idea from concept to marketing. It covers every stage of the product/service creation lifecycle — from ideation and validation to defining the MVP specifications, prototyping, and planning marketing activities. The application also integrates a centralized file management system and a contextual AI assistant that guides users, validates input against internal standards, and automates document formatting tasks. With these capabilities, the platform aims to maximize innovation success by offering a cohesive and practical workflow.

The project is being built to simplify and streamline the often complex process of developing a minimum viable product (MVP). By breaking the lifecycle into clearly defined phases and providing dynamic tools for each phase, the platform ensures that the best ideas are fully explored and validated. Key success criteria include robust documentation management, seamless integration with third-party services (like GitHub and Google Docs), and an AI assistant that reliably provides context-aware guidance and automation.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**
- End-to-end guided workflow covering project setup, ideation, validation, business model and value chain development, MVP specification, prototyping, and marketing.
- A centralized File Management System (FS) for storing and managing project documents and assets, with features to organize, preview, upload/download, rename, delete, and sync files.
- An AI Agent integrated into the UI to provide contextual guidance, validate inputs, automate document formatting (using models like Claude 3.7, GPT o3-mini, Gemini 2.5, and others), and reference internal standards/templates.
- A user interface with a consistent dark theme (navy background with electric blue/purple accents, Orbitron font) and a complementary light mode.
- External integrations using OAuth 2.0 with GitHub and Google Docs for account linking, folder sync, and document sharing.
- Offline state persistence using localStorage and IndexedDB to maintain the continuity of user sessions.
- Specific project phases with dedicated UI components and navigation (e.g., interactive product type selector, idea capture zones, validation surveys, business model canvas, prototyping tools dynamic for product type, and marketing planning with timeline views).

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Real-time collaboration among multiple users (each project is managed individually in the MVP).
- Mobile and tablet device support (the platform is initially optimized for desktop and laptop use).
- Full API integration for certain modules such as generative video creation and advanced live research tools (these will serve as placeholders or planning-only modules in the MVP).
- Extensive customizations for non-core user roles beyond the basic differences between Project Admins, Team Collaborators, and Solo Entrepreneurs.

## 3. User Flow

A user starts by logging into the platform or being automatically redirected to a central Dashboard if already authenticated. On this dashboard, the user is greeted by a clean, futuristic interface with dark or light mode options, dynamic breadcrumbs showing their progress, and clearly marked section headers. The first step is the Project Setup phase where the user selects a product type using interactive cards. This choice is saved globally so that the system tailors later phases to the specific project requirements, and the user receives immediate confirmation through a toast notification.

After setting up the project, the user seamlessly moves through a clearly delineated series of phases — starting with Ideation, where ideas and counter-intuitive strategies are captured; then onto Validation using survey management and data partner selection; followed by strategic Business Model Canvas and Value Chain analyses. Next, the user enters the MVP Specification phase where they interact with an AI-guided wizard to define core features, user stories, and acceptance criteria, ultimately generating formatted documents saved directly to the File Management System. The journey then continues into Prototyping and Marketing, using tailored tools based on the earlier product type selection, ensuring that each step of development is well-documented and aligned with internal standards.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- The MVP is designed primarily for desktop and laptop use, with potential mobile support planned for future versions.
- Each project is managed individually with sharing options via third-party integrations; real-time collaboration is not included in the MVP.
- The application relies on external services (GitHub, Google Docs, meshy.ai, video generation APIs), and their availability and API rate limits must be considered.
- State persistence is managed via localStorage and IndexedDB, and a basic offline capability is assumed with cloud-based backup strategies.
- The AI assistant will rely on models like Claude 3.7, GPT o3-mini, and Gemini 2.5 via API, with integration managed through tools like Cursor and Lovable.
- The backend will be hosted on AWS or Google Cloud, using managed databases (AWS RDS/GCP Cloud SQL) and storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage) for file and data management.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- External API integrations (GitHub, Google Docs, meshy.ai, video generation) may encounter rate limits or occasional downtime.  
  • Mitigation: Implement robust error logging, user feedback, auto-retry logic with exponential back-off, and manual override options.

- Data synchronization between localStorage/IndexedDB and cloud backups might introduce conflicts.  
  • Mitigation: Ensure state is saved frequently and that conflict resolution strategies are in place.

- UI consistency across dark and light themes could be challenging with dynamic components and third-party integrations.  
  • Mitigation: Regular UI tests and cross-browser checks to ensure design uniformity.

- The AI-assisted guidance must consistently reference the most current internal standards and templates.  
  • Mitigation: Centralize standards in a version-controlled repository and implement periodic checks by the AI agent for updates.

- Advanced features like generative video and real-time diagram generation might require extensive testing once external APIs are finalized.  
  • Mitigation: Initially implement placeholder interfaces with robust error handling, and plan for iterative enhancements post-MVP.
