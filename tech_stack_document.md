# Tech Stack Document

This document outlines the technology choices made for our comprehensive MVP development platform. The goal is to create a structured, guided, and cutting-edge environment that enables entrepreneurs, startup teams, and innovation managers to develop their ideas from concept to market launch. Below, you’ll find a breakdown of the technologies used and the rationale behind each choice.

## Frontend Technologies

Our user interface is designed to be both visually engaging and highly functional. The following technologies and tools power the frontend:

- **React**: Provides a modern, component-driven approach to building interactive UIs. React ensures our dynamic views update smoothly, delivering a responsive experience.
- **Styling Tools and UI Libraries**:
  - Custom dark mode (navy background with electric blue/purple accents) and a complementary light mode for accessibility.
  - Orbitron font to deliver a futuristic, clean look.
  - Dynamic components like interactive cards, breadcrumbs, and tab-based navigation enhance the user experience in various phases of the application.
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - **MermaidJS**: Used for generating dynamic architecture diagrams and flowcharts, helping users visualize complex processes.
  - **Chart.js**: Enables the display of interactive charts and data visualizations, particularly in market validation and survey result analysis.
- **State Persistence**:
  - **localStorage & IndexedDB**: These technologies ensure that user inputs (such as product type choices, project settings, or form entries) are saved locally, providing session continuity and basic offline capabilities.

These frontend choices create an intuitive and visually appealing experience, making navigation and interaction simple for users with varying levels of technical proficiency.

## Backend Technologies

The backend components ensure the application runs smoothly and efficiently, handling everything from data processing to integration with third-party services. Here are the key backend technologies used:

- **Server Framework & Runtime Environment**:
  - **Node.js & Express**: Serve as the backbone for our server-side operations. They manage HTTP requests, handle business logic, and facilitate rapid development of APIs.
- **Database & Data Management**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database providing structured data storage for user information, project metadata, and other critical information.
- **File Management & Cloud Storage**:
  - **AWS S3**: Integrates as the file storage layer, especially for our centralized File Management System that handles documents and assets from various project phases.
- **Authentication & Integration Protocols**:
  - **OAuth 2.0**: Critical for secure integrations with third-party services like GitHub and Google Docs. It ensures safe, scoped permissions and maintains user data security.
- **Third-party API Integrations**:
  - Integration with AI tools such as **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, **GPT o3-mini**, and **Gemini 2.5** provide the contextual AI guidance that supports users throughout the MVP process.
  - **meshy.ai_api**: Powers our 3D model generation in the prototyping phase.
  - **video_generation_api**: (Under evaluation) Intended for integrating generative video services in the marketing phase.

Together, these backend technologies work in harmony to ensure that the application’s functionality and data management are robust, scalable, and secure.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Reliable infrastructure and efficient deployment processes are core to the platform’s performance and continuous improvement. We have chosen the following tools and practices:

- **Cloud Hosting**:
  - **AWS**: Our primary choice for hosting the backend services, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  - Managed database services such as AWS RDS (with PostgreSQL) are used to maintain structured and secure data storage.
- **Cloud Storage**:
  - **AWS S3** provides a scalable solution for our centralized file management needs, handling everything from document previews to file synchronization.
- **CI/CD Pipelines and Version Control**:
  - Robust CI/CD pipelines (integrated with tools like GitHub) allow for continuous integration, automated testing, and smooth deployment cycles.
  - **GitHub** serves as our version control system, ensuring that source code changes are tracked, reviewed, and merged effectively.

These infrastructure choices ensure that our platform is not only reliable but also flexible enough to support future scaling and enhancements.

## Third-Party Integrations

To enhance the platform’s functionality without building everything from scratch, we’ve incorporated several third-party integrations:

- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Allows users to link, sync, and manage version-controlled project documents through OAuth authentication.
- **Google Docs Integration**:
  - Enables users to create and link documents seamlessly, using OAuth 2.0 for secure connection and document management.
- **AI Services Integration**:
  - Integrates advanced AI capabilities via **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, **GPT o3-mini**, and **Gemini 2.5**, ensuring real-time assistance and input validation as users work on their MVP specification.
- **Specialized Services**:
  - **meshy.ai_api**: Powers the 3D model generation for physical product prototyping.
  - **video_generation_api**: Planned integration for generating promotional videos in the marketing phase.

These integrations expand the platform’s capabilities and provide users with industry-standard tools easily accessible within a unified interface.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping user data secure and ensuring high performance are top priorities. The following measures have been implemented:

- **Security Measures**:
  - **OAuth 2.0**: Used for secure third-party integrations, ensuring that authentication is handled safely without exposing credentials.
  - Encryption via HTTPS and secure session management guarantee that data is protected both in transit and at rest.
  - Regular security audits and adherence to best practices minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Efficient data caching and state persistence (localStorage & IndexedDB) ensure that the application responds quickly and remains responsive even if network issues arise.
  - Robust error handling and retry logic (including exponential backoff strategies) ensure that the platform degrades gracefully in the event of integration issues.
  - Cloud-based backup strategies are in place to prevent data loss and ensure continuity.

By focusing on these security and performance aspects, we ensure that the user experience remains smooth and reliable under all conditions.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To recap, our platform’s tech stack is carefully chosen to support a complete and structured MVP development process. Here’s a brief summary of our choices:

- **Frontend**: React-based interface with custom dark/light themes, enhanced by visualization libraries such as MermaidJS and Chart.js. Persistent state management through localStorage and IndexedDB ensures continuity.
- **Backend**: A robust Node.js/Express environment with PostgreSQL for data management, integrated with AWS services (including S3 for file storage) and secure OAuth 2.0 authentication protocols.
- **Infrastructure**: AWS cloud hosting, managed CI/CD pipelines, and GitHub for seamless and reliable deployment processes.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Key services such as GitHub, Google Docs, meshy.ai_api for 3D modeling, and planned video generation APIs, enabling a comprehensive, connected ecosystem.
